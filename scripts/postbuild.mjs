// Post-build: copy the Python sidecars into dist/ and prove they arrived.
//
// This used to be two npm scripts made of shell commands:
//
//   mkdir -p dist/verify/checks/_py && cp src/verify/checks/_py/*.py dist/...
//
// npm runs scripts through cmd.exe on Windows, where `mkdir` is a builtin that
// rejects `-p` ("The syntax of the command is incorrect"), so `npm run build`
// had never worked there. Nothing caught it because the only job that built was
// ubuntu-only; the Windows matrix ran tests without ever building. Adding a
// build step to the test job surfaced it.
//
// The sidecars are copied rather than emitted by tsc, so a regression here is
// silent at build time and fatal at runtime: every Python verdict fails against
// a missing sidecar. That is why this asserts rather than trusting the copy,
// and why the list is derived from the source directory instead of hardcoded —
// a fourth sidecar would otherwise ship unverified.
